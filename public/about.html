<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi guys, this is Bhavesh Patil. I am doing this full-stack web developer course by Angela Yu. 
  I currently do Digital Marketing and I am interested in web development as well. 
  I hope this will be really good experience for me to buld my own website with HTML.

  This course is really cool as I have already learned so many things about HTML. 
  I have learned heading elements, paragraphy elements and self closing tags in the basics.
  In intermediate I went through list elements, nesting & indentation, anchor elements and image elements.
  In multi-page websites section, I understood file paths, webpages (internal linking) and HTML Boilerplate.
